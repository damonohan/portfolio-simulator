# HALO Portfolio Simulator

## Getting Started (For Non-Technical Users)

This guide will help you set up and run the HALO Portfolio Simulator on your computer with just a few clicks!

### Requirements

- A Windows PC or Mac computer
- Administrator access on your computer
- Internet connection (for initial setup)

### Step 1: Download and Extract the Files

1. Download the ZIP file that was shared with you
2. Right-click the ZIP file and select "Extract All" (Windows) or double-click it (Mac)
3. Extract the files to a location you can easily find (like your Documents folder)

### Step 2: Run the Installation Script

**That's it!** You don't need to install Python separately - our script does it all automatically:

#### For Windows:
1. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files
2. Double-click the file named `install_and_run.bat`
3. The script will:
   - Check if Python is installed
   - Download and install Python if needed (you may see security prompts)
   - Set up the environment
   - Install required packages
   - Launch the Portfolio Simulator

#### For Mac:
1. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files
2. Right-click on `install_and_run.sh` and select "Open"
   - If you get a security warning, click "Open" to proceed
3. The script will:
   - Check if Python is installed
   - Download and install Python if needed (you'll be asked for your password)
   - Set up the environment
   - Install required packages
   - Launch the Portfolio Simulator

If you have trouble running the script on Mac, you may need to open Terminal and run:
```
cd [PATH_TO_FOLDER]
chmod +x install_and_run.sh
./install_and_run.sh
```
(Replace [PATH_TO_FOLDER] with the actual path to the folder)

### Running the Simulator Again Later

After the initial setup, you can easily run the simulator again:

1. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files
2. Double-click the same file you used for installation:
   - Windows: `install_and_run.bat`
   - Mac: `install_and_run.sh`

### Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Take a screenshot of any error messages
2. Note which step you were on when the error occurred
3. Contact the person who shared the files with you
