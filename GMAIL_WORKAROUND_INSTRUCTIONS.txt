HALO PORTFOLIO SIMULATOR - INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING AROUND GMAIL FILTERS

Gmail is blocking our Portfolio Simulator package because it contains script files needed to automatically install the simulator. Here are several options for sharing it:

OPTION 1: USE A FILE SHARING SERVICE (RECOMMENDED)
-------------------------------------------------
1. Upload the "portfolio_simulator_one_click_install.zip" file to one of these services:
   - Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/
   - Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/
   - OneDrive: https://onedrive.live.com/
   - WeTransfer: https://wetransfer.com/

2. Create a shareable link and send that link to your recipients.

3. They can download the ZIP file directly and follow the installation instructions.


OPTION 2: SEND TWO SEPARATE ZIP FILES
------------------------------------
1. Send the "portfolio_simulator_safe.zip" file as an email attachment
   (This contains the core program without any installation scripts)

2. Send the "portfolio_simulator_scripts.zip" file separately
   (This contains the installation scripts that make it easy to run)

3. Instruct your recipients to:
   a. Download and extract both ZIP files
   b. Copy all files from the "portfolio_simulator_scripts" folder into the 
      "portfolio_simulator_safe" folder
   c. Rename the "portfolio_simulator_safe" folder to "portfolio_simulator"
   d. Run the appropriate installation script:
      - Windows: double-click "install_and_run.bat"
      - Mac: right-click "install_and_run.sh" and select "Open"


OPTION 3: RENAME THE ZIP EXTENSION
---------------------------------
1. Rename "portfolio_simulator_one_click_install.zip" to "portfolio_simulator_one_click_install.zi_" 
   (just changing the extension)

2. Send it as an email attachment

3. Instruct your recipients to:
   a. Download the file
   b. Rename it back to "portfolio_simulator_one_click_install.zip"
   c. Extract the ZIP file
   d. Run the appropriate installation script


OPTION 4: PASSWORD-PROTECTED ZIP
-------------------------------
1. Send the "portfolio_simulator_protected.zip" file as an attachment

2. Tell your recipients the password is: portfolio2025

3. When they try to extract the ZIP file, they'll be prompted for this password

4. After extraction, they can run the appropriate installation script
